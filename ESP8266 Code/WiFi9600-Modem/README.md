sThe modem firmware is using the code from this project:  https://github.com/dhansel/WifiModem

Modifications include support for LED activity and playing sounds. 

There are also a couple of places where `millis()` isn't handled correctly. (When I'm done with my project, I'll fork and submit a PR.)
