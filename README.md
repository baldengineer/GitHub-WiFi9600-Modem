# WiFi9600 Modem
 Retro-cyling a Practical Peripherals 9600SA into a WiFiModem

Design files and code for WiFi9600.

As a kid, I had a Practical Peripherals 9600SA. For years I used it to connect to BBSes and then the Internet. At least, until I upgraded to a 56K USR Sportser.

This project removes the original electronics and replaces them with an ESP8266, MP3 Player, and some relays. It allows classic computers with a RS-232 port to connect to the internet via telnet. 

The MP3 player enables authentic fake modem sounds. And the relays are there for authentic real clicky-clicks.
